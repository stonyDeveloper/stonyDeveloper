Hi, I'm @stonyDeveloper,

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Three.js to create immersive 3D experiences in web applications.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects involving React, Next.js, TypeScript, or Three.js, especially those focusing on interactive and visually engaging web experiences.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about building responsive and scalable frontend applications, integrating animations and 3D graphics, or structuring React applications with TypeScript.
